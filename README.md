# faceRecognitionProject

To contribute to the research of this application of facial recognition and its uses,
we seek to create our own smart door lock that utilizes facial recognition to provide entry to authorized individuals.
How it works is that the software will capture an image of an individual posing in front of a camera. 
This image will  then be compared to the dataset that will be saved in a database. 
If the image captured by the software is identical to one of the images saved in the database, the door will unlock.
